# View File Queue

Open the file queue viewer in Chrome app mode.

**What this does:**
1. Checks if the viewer server is running on port 8765
2. Starts the server if needed (runs in background)
3. Opens Chrome in app mode to display the queue viewer
4. Leaves server running for future use

**Instructions:**
Run `./scripts/view_queue.sh` which handles server startup and Chrome launching.

Open the file queue viewer now.
