## File Organization Strategy

Given the existing `~/Dropbox/Filing/` structure is entity-based rather than file-type based:
- **Financial documents**: Place in appropriate entity folder in `~/Dropbox/Filing/`
- **Personal documents**: Place in appropriate entity folder or create new entity folder
- **DMG/installers**: `~/Files/installers/` (needs creation)
- **Screenshots**: `~/Files/screenshots/` (needs creation)
- **Unclear files**: `~/Files/unknown/` (needs creation)
